        <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork cubes, sliced onions, minced garlic, soy sauce, and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Mix well, ensuring that the pork is evenly coated with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li>In a wide, heavy-bottomed pan or pot, heat the cooking oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated pork mixture to the pan.</li>
        <li>Sear the pork pieces until they are brown on all sides. This helps enhance the flavor of the dish.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vinegar and allow it to boil for a few minutes to get rid of its strong smell.</li>
        <li>Add water, bay leaves, and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 40-50 minutes or until the pork becomes tender. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Taste the adobo and adjust the seasoning by adding more soy sauce, vinegar, or pepper according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li>Once the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened, remove the pot from heat.</li>
        <li>Serve the Pork Adobo hot over steamed rice.</li>
